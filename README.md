# Yet Another JSON Parser

A JSON parser implementing tokenizing and parsing written in C++.

## Usage

Using this library requires building the project and copying the compiled static
library file as well as `parser.h` and `value.h` header files. The `example` directory
contains code demonstrating how to use the parser and extract useful data from the
returned `Value` object.

## Building

Building this project requires a recent CMake version, a modern C++ compiler supporting C++17,
and Make, Visual Studio, or some other tools depending on target platform.
